# Lecture 1: Practice Questions
# CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python

# -------------------------------
# 1. Simple Comparison
# -------------------------------
# Write a program that takes two integers, x and y, as input.
# Compare x and y and print:
# - "x is less than y" if x < y
# - "x is greater than y" if x > y
# - "x is equal to y" otherwise.

# -------------------------------
# 2. Simplified Comparison
# -------------------------------
# Modify the program from Question 1 to:
# - Print "x is not equal to y" if x != y.
# - Print "x is equal to y" otherwise.

# -------------------------------
# 3. Grading System
# -------------------------------
# Write a program that asks the user for a score (0-100).
# Based on the score, print the grade:
# - "Grade: A" for scores >= 90
# - "Grade: B" for scores >= 80 and < 90
# - "Grade: C" for scores >= 70 and < 80
# - "Grade: D" for scores >= 60 and < 70
# - "Grade: F" for scores < 60

# -------------------------------
# 4. Parity Check
# -------------------------------
# Write a function `is_even(n)` that:
# - Returns True if n is even, False otherwise.
# Then, write a program that:
# - Asks the user for a number.
# - Uses the `is_even` function to determine if the number is even or odd.
# - Prints "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.

# -------------------------------
# 5. Hogwarts House Sorting
# -------------------------------
# Write a program that asks the user for their name.
# Based on the name, print:
# - "Gryffindor" for "Harry", "Hermione", or "Ron".
# - "Slytherin" for "Draco".
# - "Who?" for any other name.
# Use a `match` statement to implement this.
