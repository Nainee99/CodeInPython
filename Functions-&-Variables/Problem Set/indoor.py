# Problem 1: Indoor Voice
# -------------------------------
# WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.
# Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
# 
# In this program, you will prompt the user for input and then output that 
# same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.
# You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, 
# as by passing a string of your own as an argument to input.
#
# Task:
# - Prompt the user for a string.
# - Output the string in lowercase.
#
# Example:
# Input: "HELLO THERE, HOW ARE YOU?"
# Output: "hello there, how are you?"
#
# -------------------------------

# Your code starts here:
string_input = input("Please enter a string: ")
print(string_input.lower())
